**3. Redemption Preferences**
Shopping Discounts were the most preferred redemption category.

**4. Store Activity Patterns**
High activity: Parramatta, Bankstown, Hornsby, Blacktown, Campbelltown
Low redemption: Penrith, Liverpool, Chatswood — possibly due to Saved points for bigger rewards
Lower awareness or fewer store promotions
Online redemption instead of in-store
Perceived low value at those locations
